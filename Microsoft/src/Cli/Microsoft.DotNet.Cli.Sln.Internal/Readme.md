<p>The Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.Sln.Internal  project was scooped from the Microsoft.DotNet.Cli so we could make changes to the solution file.</p>
<p>A few small changes were made to avoid compile warnings and the PathUtility.cs was brought over from the Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.Utils project</p>
<p>We also tossed the Localization feature as this is all internal use.</p>
