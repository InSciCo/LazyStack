            <summary>
            HTTP message handler capable of signing requests using Signature Version 4. This class is
            designed to be compatible with
            <see href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.ihttpclientfactory">
            IHttpClientFactory</see> and its request pipeline. For more information about message
            handlers and their usage, please see
            <see href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/web-api/overview/advanced/http-message-handlers">
            HTTP Message Handlers in ASP.NET Web API</see>.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Please make sure to leave the request unchanged after having it signed. Any changes in
            subsequent message handlers will render the signature invalid.
