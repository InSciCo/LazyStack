            <div class="lb-rtxt"> 
             <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share personal information only as described below and with InSciCo.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries that InSciCo.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li><b>Transactions Involving Third Parties:</b> We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through InSciCo Offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share information related to those transactions with that third party. For example, you can order services, software, and content from sellers using the InSciCo Marketplace and we provide those sellers information to facilitate your subscription, purchases, or support.</li> 
              <li><b>Third-Party Service Providers:</b> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: delivering InSciCo hardware, sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training. These third party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection law.</li> 
              <li><b>Business Transfers: </b>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise). Also, in the event that InSciCo or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li> 
              <li><b>Protection of Us and Others: </b>We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of InSciCo, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.</li> 
              <li><b>At Your Option: </b>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.<br> </li>
