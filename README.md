## LazyStack Libraries
This repo contains a number of open-source MIT licensed libraries and tools you may use in client applications. 
Our intention is to ensure that these libraries are useful even if you are not using LazyStack to generate your stacks.

- LazyStackAuth -- generalized authentication model with support for AWS Cognito.
- LazyStackAuthTest -- integration tests.
- LazyStackGetAwsSettings -- .NET console app that retrieves client app settings from AWS.
- LazyStackAuthConsoleApp -- .NET console app demonstrating authentication and secure calls.
- LazyStackDynamoDBRepo -- an opinionated CRUDL library for DynamoDB to accelerate development.

## LazyStack Generator
LazyStack ingests an OpenApi (swagger) REST API specification and generates the AWS Server Application Model (SAM) 
configuration and C# projects necessary to stand up a fully featured commercial-grade application stack in AWS. 
It also generates a client application SDK making it simple to call that stack from C# applications.

A free version of the LazyStack Generator is available in the Visual Studio Extensions Marketplace and as a 
.NET Core CLI tool.
